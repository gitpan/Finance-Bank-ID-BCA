=head1 NAME

parse-bca-statement - Parse BCA internet banking statement

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.32 of parse-bca-statement (from Perl distribution Finance-Bank-ID-BCA), released on 2014-12-10.

=head1 COMPLETION

This script has shell tab completion capability with support for several shells.

=head2 bash

To activate bash completion for this script, put:

 complete -C parse-bca-statement parse-bca-statement

in your bash startup (e.g. C<~/.bashrc>). Your next shell session will then recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the line above in your shell to activate immediately.

You can also install L<App::BashCompletionProg> which makes it easy to add completion for Getopt::Long::Complete-based scripts. After you install the module and put C<. ~/.bash-complete-prog> (or C<. /etc/bash-complete-prog>), you can just run C<bash-completion-prog> and the C<complete> command will be added to your C<~/.bash-completion-prog>. Your next shell session will then recognize tab completion for the command.

=head2 fish

To activate fish completion for this script, execute:

 begin; set -lx COMP_SHELL fish; set -lx COMP_MODE gen_command; parse-bca-statement; end > $HOME/.config/fish/completions/parse-bca-statement.fish

Or if you want to install globally, you can instead write the generated script to C</etc/fish/completions/parse-bca-statement.fish> or C</usr/share/fish/completions/parse-bca-statement.fish>. The exact path might be different on your system. Please check your C<fish_complete_path> variable.

=head2 tcsh

To activate tcsh completion for this script, put:

 complete parse-bca-statement 'p/*/`parse-bca-statement`/'

in your tcsh startup (e.g. C<~/.tcshrc>). Your next shell session will then recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the line above in your shell to activate immediately.

=head2 zsh

To activate zsh completion for this script, put:

 _parse_bca_statement() { read -l; local cl="$REPLY"; read -ln; local cp="$REPLY"; reply=(`COMP_SHELL=zsh COMP_LINE="$cl" COMP_POINT="$cp" parse-bca-statement`) }

 compctl -K _parse_bca_statement parse-bca-statement

in your zsh startup (e.g. C<~/.zshrc>). Your next shell session will then recognize tab completion for the command. Or, you can also directly execute the line above in your shell to activate immediately.
